# SecretsDepartment
Work from home in the SECRETS DEPARTMENT!

This is an open-source video game about working at the SECRETS DEPARTMENT.
Every company has a ton of secrets, and its up to you to keep them. Or find
them out, if it's another company. They can be worth the big bucks! It uses the
PUZZLE system, which is my own RPG / choose-your-own-adventure hybrid style of
gameplay.
